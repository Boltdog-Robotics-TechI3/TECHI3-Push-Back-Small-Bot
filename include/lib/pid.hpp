/**
 * Class representing a PID controller.
 * It contains the PID gains, setpoint, measurement, and other variables needed for PID control.
 * It also contains methods for calculating the output of the PID controller and checking if the error is within a certain range.
 * 
 * For usage, the calculate method should be placed inside of a loop, and the setpoint and measurement should be updated accordingly.
 * The error range functions may be used to for timeout purposes.
